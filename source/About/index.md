I am a student major in Probability and Statistics. Years before, I had the idea to build a blog to record my learning and share some ideas and stories. This time I will insist on what I am doing now. I will mainly upload my reading notes which I think it is worthy for me to make a summary. Therefore, you will not find very creative thoughts most of the time. As I quoted at the beginning of this page, I just would like to leave a place for me to see my progress. It is more like a self-talk than sharing knowledge.
